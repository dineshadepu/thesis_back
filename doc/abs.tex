\begin{Abstract}
Rigid body simulation in fluid flows has been gaining interest. In particular rigid
bodies in free surface flows has been a keen interest these days. Many proposals
have made in order to model such phenomena. Among which Smoothed Particle
Hydrodynamics (SPH) has man advantages in modelling the free surface when com-
pared to grid based method. Coupling the fluid with solid body is also seamlessly
done using SPH and Discrete Element Method (DEM) as only the acceleration from
solid particle is need to be added.
Since solving pressure Poisson equation to evaluate pressure is expensive,
weakly compressible scheme is adapted.
In the present work fluid flow equations are numerically implemented using
SPH and rigid bodies using DEM. Coupling of these two phases is done using the
two numerical tools DEM and SPH. To evaluate force on solid body due to fluid,
solid body is also discetized to fluid particles and the coupling is considered.
