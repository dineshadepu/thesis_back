\chapter{Results and Discussions}


A quantitative result is been produced to compare SPH and bonded DEM coupling
for by simulating deformation of elastic gate under dam break. Fluid is left
free under gravity which was initially kept in rest by an elastic gate. Under
the fluid pressure the elastic gate will be deformed.
