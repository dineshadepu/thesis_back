\label{cha:future-work}


In the present thesis simulation of rigid bodies in fluid flow is done using SPH
and DEM\,. Using bonded DEM dynamics of elastic bodies are simulated.  Later
bonded DEM is coupled with SPH to simulate fluid structure interaction
problems. Fracture of structures in the literature is also done using lattice
models.  Where every particle is connected to it's neighbours by a beam, and the
beam follows Euler-Bernoulli beam theory or Timoshenko beam theory. There is
also similar model where a potential energy assumed in the beam, and forces are
computed according to the particles positions.


After implementing other models of elastic models, one can couple it with SPH
and a comparison test could be done.
